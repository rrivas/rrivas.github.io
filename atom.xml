    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After trying to get a blog up so many times in the past, I finally just forced myself to do it.
Thankfully there are loads of options that will make it easy for anyone to get up and going.</p>

<p>My primary reason for starting this is to keep track of my technical thoughts and understandings.
I read a wide variety of technical tutorials, blogs, books, etc., and learn a lot.
Sadly, things get foggy after some time. So to combat that feeling, I&rsquo;m going to use this as notes to what I have learned.
Reminds me of college days, escept that, hopefully I find these notes more useful.</p>

<p>Let the games begin!</p>
