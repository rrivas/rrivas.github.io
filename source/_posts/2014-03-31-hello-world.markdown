After trying to get a blog up so many times in the past, I finally just forced myself to do it.
Thankfully there are loads of options that will make it easy for anyone to get up and going.

My primary reason for starting this is to keep track of my technical thoughts and understandings.
I read a wide variety of technical tutorials, blogs, books, etc., and learn a lot.
Sadly, things get foggy after some time. So to combat that feeling, I'm going to use this as notes to what I have learned.
Reminds me of college days, escept that, hopefully I find these notes more useful.

Let the games begin!
